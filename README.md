  <h1 align="center"> Hi 👋, I'm Saul Fernandez</h2>
  <h4 align="center">MLOps & SRE & DevOps Engineer, Cloud Architect, Consultant and Sith Lord automating the dark side of the infrastructure.</h4>
</p>

- 💡 I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams and finding solutions to complex problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently mastering my dark powers but also sharpening my coding skills.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects where are people better than me, who know more than me.
- 🤔 I’m looking for mentors. Having a good mentor is a life changer.
- 💬 Ask me about mentoring, about your career, about how can I help you. Lets chat about how we can help each other, because that's what life is about. One day for you, the next for me.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m a big fan of RPG, boardgames, roman and japan history.
